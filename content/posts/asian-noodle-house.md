Asian noodle house is a cute lil ..uhh.. asian themed restaurant. I arrived for lunch at 12:30 and there were only two seats left of a full room. Mostly white people.

I saw they had various lunch deals including curry, noodles and stir frys. I got the laksa lunch deal which came with 2 spring roll, laksa and a drink. Laksa SLAPPED hard. Would defs go back. Lots of different meats, vegs and good spice level.

Only reason it's not S tier cause it's a tad expenny.
