Bamiyan is a cute lil Afghan shop that serves tasty meats. I've been here a few times at lunch and it's always quiet, no idea why because the food slaps hard. 

Today we got the Kabuli Pallow with lamb which is like oily rice with lamb chunks; and lemme say this rice is some of the tastiest rice I've had. And I'm Chinese. It also came with a curry which was noice but not mind blowing.

The Afghan Testy plate (wtf is that?) is just a collection of various meats, naan and salads. It had chicken, beef, dumplings, bread, 2 sauces and salad. Probably wouldn't get this again but it was nice to try all the different items. The dumplings were a stand out.

10/10 quantity but not sure if that was because we spent 32 bucks each. Oh well yolo
