Fish shack is a cute lil hut serving up tasty seafood and vegan options. Location is kinda weird cause it's on the side of the road with moderate traffic flow but also pretty central and easy to walk to. I appreciate the cute ocean artwork around the building.

Today I got the snack pack, normally on Wednesdays they have an ocean basket for like $12 but I came on the wrong day. Snack pack included various seafoods which I shall rate now:

* Battered barra x3: S tier
* Calimari rings x2: A tier
* Squid tentacle chewy thing x1? (might have been a freebie?): C tier
* Prawns x2: S tier
* Chips x75: A tier (so many I couldn't finish)

I would have also liked a lot more tartare sauce, that would have probably bumped the rating up to S, but alas, they will have to settle for A.
