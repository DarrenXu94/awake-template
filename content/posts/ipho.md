iPho is a cute lil Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of the city. The outdoor sitting area is a visually unappealing area with hoards of magpies swarming and high foot traffic walking past. That's when you know the pho is gonna be lit.

The usual condiments were offered, chilli, basil and that crunchy yellow bean sprout thing. The broth was tasty and meat adequate. I was hoping for a bit more quantity but for $17 it's not all that bad.
