Papa Rich a cute lil Malay style restaurant based in the heart of the city. The restaurant itself is actually hella fancy with some very aesthetic interior decor and plant vibes. This caught me by surprise when I saw the prices of the food as it was actually extremely reasonable. 

I got the Nasi Lemak main and shared an entree of Satay skewers. I reckon the entree came out within 2 minutes of ordering, and the mains literally after I finished eating 1 skewer. Big kudos on the speed. The sauce on the plate was very generous (as seen above) and probably was more than the advertised amount in the photos. The flavour was perfecto and I only wish they gave me more rice to soak up all the sauce. 

Papa Rich is as close as you can get to S tier without being there...maybe next time with more rice.
