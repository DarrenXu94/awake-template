Sandoochie (AKA Le Dooch) is a cute lil sandwich shop offering home made sandwiches on fresh baked bread. The menu appears to be rotating as there were 4 sandwiches on display today. I tried both the Turkey and Eggplant schnitzel sandwiches.

Thoughts: 

\- you better love cheese cause it's creamy. Luckily I do love cheese. 

\- quite small and not quite filling enough. Maybe get 2 if you're hungry.

\- flavours were exciting and different

Would recommend eggplant schnit
