T﻿aki is a quaint lil o Japanese restaurant located in the new fancy schmancy wannabe Chinatown of civic. It looks super sleek and modern from outside. I visited this fine establishment for a romantic workplace lunch date on valentines day.

I﻿ decided to order the lunch deal as I was overwhelmed by the regular menu and I have a low attention span. The deal I ordered was a salmon donburi. This consisted of:

\-﻿ bowl of flavoursome rice

\-﻿ some fresh and generous amount of salmon sashimi

\-﻿ some beans and other misc toppins I couldn't name

\-﻿ generic miso soup

\-﻿ cheap salad with a surprisingly tasty dressing 

T﻿otal price: 23 dolla

T﻿he taste was actually very yum. Downside is I could have eaten probably another bowl. I would recommend for people with fine taste that don't eat a lot. Not like me, I got a scroll from Baker's Delight after to tie me over hehe.
