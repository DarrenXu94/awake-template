Tikka take is a cute lil Indian restaurant with a suspisciously large menu. Not even kidding the menu is 18 pages long of like size 12 font (this doesn't even include the drinks and kids menu). I heard these guys recently got a health code violation so I wanted to risk it all today for some butter chicken.

It was $20 for some rice, small salad, papadam thingys and butter chicken. I thought the taste was sufficient but my fellow food connoisseur was not too impressed with the naan calling it 'flat and dry'. Service was reasonably fast so defs viable for an in and out luncheon. 

Reasonable experience would dine again.
